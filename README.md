In this repository, is an export of a Figma Project that formed piece of coursework for a module at University

## Task Description

You will design, develop, and evaluate a medium fidelity prototype (using Adobe XD, Figma or equivalent software) for an online digital tool (either web or mobile) that support mutual aids efforts in local neighbourhoods. The digital tool will enable matching of peopleâ€™s needs with those who can offer such help.
The expectation is that both help/resource requests and offers are designed and evaluated within the application, including notification of matches. You should focus on the design of the interface including its evaluation (through user testing or expert evaluation methods).
You should design the interface with a specific focus to at least two of the personas provided here.

Your design decisions should be informed by requirements, usability, and aesthetics and
demonstrate how somebody will use what you develop. You should test your design using either Cognitive Walkthrough, Heuristic Evaluation methods or user-led methods such as Think Aloud protocol.

The interface design should demonstrate how:

A user can add request for help and needs in their locality or advertise offers to help according to availability and interests (time, resources)
A user can discover requests for help/service in their local neighbourhood.
Demand and response can be matched.
Users can be notified when a match occurs.
Consider the following variations:

Type of help/request (e.g. lift to the doctor, borrowing goods or resources such as books, help with shopping, donating food, etc.)
Time / day of availability to help or need for help (e.g. weekdays/weekend, morning, afternoon, evening)
Geographical locations (including radius of catchment area)
### Extensions
You can also develop additional materials to supplement the methods described above. 

Develop additional personas
Review the state of the art and competitor analysis review of existing similar products
Develop a storyboard to illustrate context of use 
Branding 
Research and recommend how your product could be discoverable by relevant users
Add search facility to allow for the search of specific needs and interests and make recommendations for people who have been particularly helpful. 

## What Was Done?
- I first started by chosing 2 personas to base my designs from
  - I went with the perspective of a retired 81 year old man, and a young adult, for a wide range of audiences
- I then came up with a scenerio, in which provides a use case for the application
- I then moved onto low fidelity sketches and wireframes
- Next, I consulted peers for feedback, using Heuristic Evaluation
- Using the feedback, I then moved onto hig fidelity designs which I used Figma to create.
- Finally, I consulted my peers once again for an evaluation of the design. To gain any feedback for changes that could be made.

## What's next?
- I could implement some of the changes proposed in my final evaluation. As this was not within the scope and / or timescale of the assignment. 
- While not part of the assignment, I could move on to experimenting with developing the application, to the designs I created for fun. I would have to chose a suitable language and framework to use. For example Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS.
